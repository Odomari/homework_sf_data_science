### What problem are we solving?
We need to perform data visualization tasks and, if necessary, comment on the diagrams and made conclusions.

**What we practice**
Learning to visualize data using the plotly libraries.

### Short information about data
- churn.csv - a file with data about the churn of clients of a certain bank;
- churn.ipynb - completed task file.
