### Deskription of task
Imagine that you are a data scientist at Booking. One of the problems of the company is dishonest hotels that wind up their rating. One way to discover such hotels is to build a model that predicts the rating of the hotel. If the predictions of the model are very different from the actual result, then the hotel may be behaving dishonestly and worth checking.

You are tasked with creating such a model.

### What problem are we solving?
We need to clean our dataset, create a new features, transform features and select features.

**What we practice**
The real practice of EDA.

### Result
We created our first machine learning case: we cleaned a rather heavily polluted dataset ourselves, extracted several new features from it, and prepared data for model training. We also took part in the machine learning competition (https://www.kaggle.com/code/otomari/eda-project).

### Conclusions
- We created our first model based on machine learning algorithms.
- We took part in the competition on Kaggle.
- We figured out how to properly “prepare” the data so that our model performs better.
