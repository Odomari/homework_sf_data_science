### Deskription of task
Transform, explore and clean vacancy data from hh.ru.

### What problem are we solving?
We need to transform, explore and clean vacancies, build graphs and, if necessary, comment on the diagrams and made conclusions.

**What we practice**
It`s a first real data-science project. We practice our skills in transform data, vizualization data and data cleaning.

### Short information about data
- Project_1.ipynb - notebook file with code, completed tasks and graphs;
- dst-3.0_16_1_hh_database.csv - dataset with vacancies from hh.ru (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kb78mAWYKcYlellTGhIjPI-bCcKbGuTn/view?usp=sharing);
- ExchangeRates.csv - file with exchange rates for the period from 12/29/2017 to 12/05/2019 (https://lms.skillfactory.ru/assets/courseware/v1/15abf80f45a2f3e93c3274101b451c67/asset-v1:SkillFactory+DSPR-2.0+14JULY2021+type@asset+block/ExchangeRates.zip)
- graphics - folder with graphics

### Result
All tasks completed. Graphs shown. Conclusions are drawn about the desired salary of applicants and what signs influence it and how they influence it.

### Conclusions
- We learned how to do basic data analysis.
- We have learned how to transform data into a form that is convenient for us and for the future machine learning model.
- We learned how to build graphs, read and analyze them.
- We learned how to clean data from gaps, outliers, anomalies that are harmful to the future model.
