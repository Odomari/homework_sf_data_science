### Deskription of task
Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts.

### What problem are we solving?
We need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum steps of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**
- The computer thinks of an integer from 1 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess", I mean "write a program that guesses a number".
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.
- It is necessary to ensure that the program guesses the number in less than 20 attempts.

**Quality metric**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**
Learning to write good python code.

### Short information about data
- game.py - programm, where we guess number guessed by computer;
- game_v2.py - programm, where compyter guesses number guessed by itself in less than 20 attempts.

### Stages of work on the task
- write file 'game.py', where we guess number guessed by computer;
- write file 'game_v2.py', where computer guesses number guessed by itself in less than 20 attempts.

### Result
Taks is completed. Computer guesses number in less than 20 attempts.

### Conclusions
- We practised to write a good simple python code.
- We got acquainted with IDEs such as VS Code and Jupyter Notebook and practiced writing simple programs with them.
- We learned how to use GitHub, a tool for sharing your projects with other users. Uploaded our first mini-project to GitHub.
- Learned what Google Colab is.
