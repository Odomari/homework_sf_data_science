### Deskription of task
It's necessary to predict a biological responce of molecules from their chemical composition.

### What problem are we solving?
We need to train models using selection of hyperparameters.

**What we practice**
It's necessary to train two models: logistic regression and random forest. Next, we need to make a selection of hyperparameters using basic and advanced analysis methods. Four methods are used (GridSeachCV, RandomizedSearchCV, Hyperopt, Optuna).

### Stages of work on the task
- reading data;
- splitting data into training, validation and test sets;
- training of logistic regression's model and selection of hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV;
- training of random forest's model and selection of hyperparameters using Hyperopt and Optuna.
